# OpenRCT2 Stream Integration
This plugin allows you to enable Twitch integration with OpenRCT2. 
Plugins cannot communicate with Twitch directly, make sure to run the [OpenRCT2 Stream Integration Relay](https://github.com/oli414/OpenRCT2StreamIntegration) simultaneously.

## Prerequisites
- This plugin requires OpenRCT2 v0.4.5 or higher.

## Installation
- Download the most recent plugin file [here](https://github.com/MiraWaNeko/StreamIntegrationPlugin/releases) (`StreamIntegration.js`)
- Move/copy `StreamIntegration.js` to `<OpenRCT2 folder>/plugin` (Usually at `documents/OpenRCT2/plugin`)
- Install the OpenRCT2 Stream Integration Relay ([installation steps here](https://github.com/oli414/OpenRCT2StreamIntegration))

## Running the OpenRCT2 Stream Integration for Twitch
- Run the OpenRCT2 Stream Integration Relay (find out how on the relay's GitHub page)
- Run OpenRCT2 and load a park
- Open the Twitch Stream Integration window under the map icon and verify that the status is "Connected"
